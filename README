Assorted notes...

This tool uses data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19
Clone that repo, and pull once a day for updates, then run the script to update your database.

Data for previous days can (and frequently is) updated also, and the script processes this properly as well.
Keep that in mind when you calculate aggregates, you'll have to re-run those as well.

The PHP script is hardcoded to use the dbname covtrack, but it's an easy define near the top.

You don't have to use the seed file, the items and locations are created and dynamically updated by the script.
However, I also added a population table, and tied it back to the locations table - so to make that work for you, I've added the seed.sql file with both locations and population, so your IDs will match up.

PRs welcome!
